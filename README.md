# Java_Training

This is a repository consisting of Java challenges and learning material to further enhance my knowledge of the Java programming language.

All challenges have the challenge description commented and then are followed by my solution. These challenges are mainly from Leetcode.com, Codewars.com and hackkerank.com
Each solution also has JUnit 5 Tests to ensure test cases supplied with the challenge and additional test cases created by myself pass when my solution is implemented.

The learning section consists of examples of various features of Java being implemented to further my understanding in the various areas.
